They are thought to increase the body’s production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is critical in delivering energy to muscles during exercise. Studies show that this may improve your overall use of oxygen, benefit anaerobic threshold, increase V02 max, and enhance overall endurance performance.</p></span>

                    Cordyceps might improve immunity by stimulating cells and specific chemicals in the immune system. It might also help fight cancer cells and shrink tumor size, particularly with lung or skin cancers. Natural cordyceps is hard to get and might be expensive.</p></span>
